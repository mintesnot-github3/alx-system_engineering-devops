README file for 0x03. Shell, init files, variables and expansions.

In this project we're looking more closely into expansion as well as learning about variables and aliases. We'll also spendome time exploring the root structure of our shell and which files contain what.

TASK 0 Create a script that creates an alias.

Name: ls
Value: rm *

TASK 2 Add /action to the PATH. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.

TASK 3 Create a script that counts the number of directories in the PATH.

TASK 4 Create a script that lists environment variables.

TASK 5 Create a script that lists all local variables and environment variables, and functions.
